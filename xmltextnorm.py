    Usage: python xmltextnorm.py [infile.xml [outfile]]

    Writes a normalized version of the textual content of elements
    in the input XML file to the specified outfile as UTF-8 text.
    This is intended to make it easier compare text-based XML
    documents (such as docbook sources, XHTML files or other HTML
    that is valid XML) with a line-based diff tool such as diff,
    opendiff, xdiff etc.

    If outfile is not specified, infile is used with extension changed
    to .txt.

    If neither infile nor outfile are specified, stdin and stdout are used.

    Requires Python 2.7 or an older python with a modern version of
    ElementTree.
